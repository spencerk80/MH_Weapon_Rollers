# MH_Weapon_Rollers
These are comand line programs that take the name(s) of the hunter(s) and gives which weapons they will use.
The two supported games are Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate and Monster Hunter Generations.
In the MHG roller, the -s flag may be added to include a random hunter art into the roll.
